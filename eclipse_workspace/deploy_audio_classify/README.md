# DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio Deploy Model: Audio

This code example demonstrates how to deploy a Machine Learning (ML) model generated from DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio on PSOC&trade; 6 MCU family devices.

In this specific example, the model used here is an acoustic model/keyword spotter which takes pulse density modulation (PDM) audio data as input and detects various keywords, such as up, down, right, left, dog, cat, etc. The microphone settings are tuned for the board to be placed within a meter from the person speaking. When the code example is running on the board, it receives audio from the microphone, passes it through the Machine Learning model, and outputs information over a serial/UART terminal.

To learn how to build your own machine learning models, see [DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio](https://developer.imagimob.com/).

## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ml-deepcraft-deploy-audio](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ml-deepcraft-deploy-audio)" application with the desired name "DeployAudioModel" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062S2-AI* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062S2-AI --app-id ml-deepcraft-deploy-audio-code-example --user-app-name DeployAudioModel --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation


1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "DEEPCRAFT Studio Audio Model Example" is displayed on the UART terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [PSOC&trade; 6 MCU: Code in main() executes before the debugger halts at the first line of main()](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

## Design and implementation

In this example, the firmware reads the data from the PDM microphone to detect supported keywords.

The data captured by the PDM microphone is configured to read mono audio with a gain value of 10 and a sampling rate of 16 kHz. This data is fed to the DEEPCRAFT&trade; preprocessor through the `IMAI_AED_enqueue` function. After the preprocessor has enough data captured, the `IMAI_AED_dequeue` function returns an audio buffer stored with the preprocessed data. The confidence score output from the inference engine is then printed on the UART terminal.

To test the model, speak any of the supported keywords and check the output in the serial terminal.

> **Note:** There is a DIGITAL_BOOST_FACTOR constant specified. If you are using the same board to record data and for deployment, keep it at 1.0. In this example, with the bundled ML model, this is set to 10.0 as the model is trained on data captured at a higher amplitude.

> **Note:** The audio model provided in this example is not production ready and is provided here for reference purpose only. You are expected to develop your own model and replace the files here to quickly test the model.

The *model.c/h* files can be updated to use other models generated by the DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio. The current model detects some common keywords (up, down, left, right, etc.) using a PDM microphone. The data is collected using the tensor streaming protocol (v.2) and a PSOC&trade; 6 AI Evaluation Kit with the default settings for the PDM microphone (see [Collecting and labeling data using Microphone sensor](https://developer.imagimob.com/data-preparation/data-collection/data-collection-using-new-streaming-firmware/data-collection-microphone)). [Machine learning: DEEPCRAFT&trade; Streaming Protocol](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-imagimob-streaming-protocol) can be used to capture additional sensor data for training the model or create a new dataset for a different type of model. Open DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio to make changes and experiment further.
